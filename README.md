# Quick Sprite

### About

`QuickSprite` is a tool designed for Graal. Specifically for those still fond of the offline editor `GraalShop.exe`. This brings the online editor sprite selector to the offline editor in a way. Although not exactly the same it helps cut down on the time that would have been spent selecting sprites.
